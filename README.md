## How Do I Use it?
1. **Install Intuita.**
    1. Ensure git is initialized for your TS/JS repo (other languages? [upvote](https://feedback.intuita.io/feature-requests) them!)
2. **Build some code.**
    1. Intuita can be customized to **generate recommendations for new, changed, or all code blocks in the affected files**. The default is set to **new code blocks** for incremental improvements.
3. **Accept/reject Intuita’s recommendations** in the Explorer sidebar or in Intuita’s dedicated section in the left panel.
    1. Intuita is easily customizable to suit your needs & comes with the following default code organization rule:
        1. Import > Type Alias > Interface > Function > Class > Block > Variable > Unknown

## Why It’s Important

**Big Files** (>300LOC) → **Big Problems**

* **Code Comprehension**
    * Big messy error-prone files slow you down. Organizing legacy code is hard. Keeping a growing codebase organized is even harder.
    * You cannot effortlessly skim from top to bottom & make sense of large & disorganized files. You need to jump through the code up & down multiple times & memorize what happens at each step.
* **Code Review**
    * Code review becomes harder for unorganized files & the back, & forth between reviewer & original author for simple changes like code arrangement waste a lot of time.
* **Code Refactoring**
    * It is hard to underst& when & how to refactor a large file into smaller, more maintainable pieces, especially when the code blocks are scattered.


## I WANT MORE...

**First some context**

* We are a bunch of nerds passionate about automating the _boring_ parts of coding one use case at a time. 
* Unlike many folks who are afraid of automation replacing developers, we believe code automation enables current software developers to be *drastically more productive*. Besides that, automation reduces friction for coding & *empowers many more people to become coders*, & that's how humans can keep up with the increasing demand for technology. 
* At Intuita, we started with the simple task of code organization, & we have more impactful use cases in the new updates. *You could have a say in the next automation we build!*
