## Why would I need it?

Currently, if you want to run an arbitrary codemod, you need to fetch its script and execute it over CLI. You will likely use version control to pick some of the resulting modifications.

If you have done that already, you realise how tiresome it feels.

Our Codemod Manager speeds up this process tremendously, as shown in the table below:

| Problem | Codemod | Codemod Manager |
|:--|:--:|--:|
| Fetching the script | over CLI | already provided |
| Executing the script | over CLI | within VSCode 
| Managing the modifications| over VC | using UI
