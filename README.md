## Why would I need it as a Codemod Consumer 🧑🏾‍💻👩🏻‍💻?

To run any codemod, you fetch its script and execute it over CLI. You will likely use version control to pick some of the resulting changes.

Does that sound already _tiresome_ to you?

Imagine you need to run a dozen codemods to migrate your codebase from one version of some library to the other.

The initial process needs to be now repeated a dozen times...

Our Codemod Manager speeds up this process tremendously, as shown in the table below.

| Problem | Codemod | Codemod Manager |
|:--|:--:|--:|
| Fetching the script(s) | over CLI | already provided |
| Executing the script(s) | over CLI | within VSCode 
| Managing the changes| over VC | using UI

Now you need to care only about picking the changes you want to be committed to your repository.

For that, we organize them into cases. One case corresponds to all the changes from one codemod.

You can accept or reject the entire case or deal with every change one by one.

## Why would I need it as a Codemod Builder 🥷🏼?
After you have written a codemod, you want it to be adopted as widely as possible.

By cooperating with us, you can add your codemod to our extension and speed up the adoption of changes for the users of your software.

## Why would I need it as an Engineering Lead 👩🏾‍💼👨🏻‍💼?
You want your software to be as up-to-date as possible. Some codemods bring security updates, while some make your team more productive. No one wants to work with outdated software.

Cooperate with us and allow your team to flourish!

## Which codemods do we support?
* Next.js vX → v13
* Material UI v4 → v5
