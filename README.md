# Untangle & Move Fast.

Intuita helps you keep your code organized effortlessly & intelligently to **facilitate code comprehension, future refactoring, and code review.**

Intuita's algorithm takes into account a few dimensions:
- Definitions first, usages later
- Semantically similar code blocks closer together
- Similar types of code blocks closer together
- Other considerations you care about? [Let us know!](https://join.slack.com/t/intuita-inc/shared_invite/zt-1bjj5exxi-95yPfWi71HcO2p_sS5L2wA) 

## How does code organization help me?
When file size is small (e.g., less than 200LOC), you might not need code organization that much. But as your code grows, it brings more problems with it:
- **Code Comprehension**
  - In large and disorganized files, it's unlikely you can skim from top to bottom and make sense of the code. You probably need to jump through the code up & down several times and memorize what happens at each step.
- **Code Refactoring**
  - It is hard to understand when and how to refactor a large file into smaller, more maintainable pieces, especially when all the code blocks that could shape a meaningful chunk are scattered within many lines of code.

Let's make it more visual:
