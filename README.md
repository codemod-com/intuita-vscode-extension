# A better way to discover & run community-led codemods

Upgrade your projects with the help of codemods created by experts in the community, one framework at a time, starting with Next.js v13.4.

## 1. Discover

- Intuita is **a one-stop shop for discovering & sharing quality-governed codemods.** You don't need to install and run many codemod engines for each dependency. Simply search for your framework codemods and click run. With codemod deep links, you can reach & run your target codemod with just one click.

## 2. Run

- **Safely dry-run the codemods**, preview the changes with a user-friendly experience, adjust the changes as necessary, and apply them to your code only when you feel confident.

## 3. Customize & Improve

- Leverage the **1-click integration with Codemod Studio** and the feedback loop with the **community of Codemod Champions** to continuously improve Codemods and customize them to your needs.

> üí° Intuita is in Public Beta and we‚Äôre continuously working on improving codemods and solving any compatibility issues.
If you run into an issue while running a codemod, please [let us know ‚Üí](https://feedback.intuita.io/feature-requests-and-bugs)

## Other Features

- **Out-of-the-box Prettier Integration -** Your favorite code transformation engines such as Meta‚Äôs JSCodeshift or TS-morph will mess up the formatting. Intuita will automatically prettify the changes according to your settings, saving you much time and energy for more exciting features.
- **Multi-threading -** Execute codemods faster than you would with vanilla jscodeshift or ts-morph. Intuita's engine uses multi-threading, which is customizable via extension settings, to take full advantage of your machine's computing power and expedite large-scale changes.
