# Intuita - A Better Way To Upgrade Open-Source Dependencies.

With Intuita, you can start adopting the latest framework versions faster and easier than ever - one framework at a time, starting with Next.js v13.

> :warning: What frameworks should we support next? [Let us know ‚Üí](https://feedback.intuita.io/codemod-requests)


## Why?

- **Automates Away the Bulk of the Upgrades:** Let dozens of bots, built on Meta‚Äôs code transformation engine, automate the tedious code changes and you focus on what‚Äôs fun.
- **A Better DevX For Dependency Upgrades:** No more confusing upgrade guides and keeping track of hundreds of proprietary CLI commands. Intuita provides an easy-to-use experience for running automated dependency upgrades. One simple interface to run it all.
- **Backed by A Community of Experts:** Upgrading dependencies can be tricky. Get help from the community of experts to navigate the uncharted territories.

## Quick Start

Get started with automating dependency upgrades using Intuita in three steps:

1. Install Intuita VS Code Extension.
2. Open the Intuita sidebar menu ‚Üí View the upgrade codemod you‚Äôd like to run ‚Üí Click `Dry Run`

> üí° In this example, we‚Äôre using the [`netlify/next-runtime`](https://github.com/netlify/next-runtime/) repository and `replace-next-router` upgrade codemod.[space][space]
Intuita is in Public Beta and we‚Äôre continuously working on improving codemods and solving any compatibility issues.[space][space]
If you run into an issue while running a codemod, please [let us know ‚Üí]()

3. View the changes made by Intuita ‚Üí then apply the approved changes to your project files.

## How Does It Work?

- **Codemod Registry -** A public database of code transformation bots, aka codemods, with 9 Intuita-backed high-quality ones built in partnership with Vercel specifically for Next.js upgrade.
- **Dry Run ‚Üí  Review ‚Üí Commit -** Intuita‚Äôs bots are double-reviewed for quality. Yet, we developed the ‚ÄúDry-Run‚Äù mode to give you full control before applying changes to your code. If needed, dismiss faulty changes, commit the rest with one click, and handle exceptions later.
- **Continuous Improvement -** Bots & AI make mistakes. Our one-click issue report, with some context included, makes reporting & improving mistakes in our bots & AI a breeze.

## Features

- **Out-of-the-box Prettier Integration -** Your favorite code transformation engines such as Meta‚Äôs JSCodeshift or TS-morph will mess up the formatting. Intuita will automatically prettify the changes according to your settings, saving you much time and energy for more exciting features.
- **Multiple Transformation Engines -** Intuita supports different transformation engines under the hood, including Meta‚Äôs, Uber‚Äôs, Semgrep‚Äôs, and LLM engines - and more to come.
- **~~Parallelized Code Transformation Engine:** Intuita‚Äôs JSCodeshift is parallelized into configurable number of threads and it can be as fast as your machine, by default it used 6 threads, meaning its is 6x faster than the standard JSCodeshift.~~
