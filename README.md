# Code Organizer For TypeScript & JavaScript

Intuita helps you to arrange the order of JS/TS code blocks based on your preference to **facilitate code comprehension, refactoring & code review.** The default is to place **imports** first, followed by **types**, **interfaces**, **functions**, **classes** blocks & **variables** at the bottom of a file.

## How Do I Use it?
1. **Install Intuita.**
    1. And open your TS/JS repo (care about other languages? [upvote them here!](https://feedback.intuita.io/feature-requests))
2. **Build some code.**
    1. And let Intuita generate recommendations for new, changed, or all code blocks in the affected files (customizable in the settings). The default is "**new or changed code blocks**” for incremental improvements.
3. **Accept/reject Intuita’s recommendations** in the Explorer sidebar or in Intuita’s dedicated section in the left panel.

## Why It’s Important

**Big Files** (>300LOC) → **Big Problems**

* **Code Comprehension**
    * Big messy error-prone files slow you down. Organizing legacy code is hard. Keeping a growing codebase organized is even harder.
    * You cannot effortlessly skim from top to bottom & make sense of large & disorganized files. You need to jump through the code up & down multiple times & memorize what happens at each step.
* **Code Review**
    * Code review becomes harder for unorganized files & the back, & forth between reviewer & original author for simple changes like code arrangement waste a lot of time.
* **Code Refactoring**
    * It is hard to underst& when & how to refactor a large file into smaller, more maintainable pieces, especially when the code blocks are scattered.


## I WANT MORE...
* **First, some context about us**
    * We are a bunch of nerds passionate about automating the _boring_ parts of coding, one use case at a time. 
    * Unlike many folks who are afraid of automation replacing developers, we believe code automation enables current software developers to be *drastically more productive*. Besides that, automation reduces friction for coding & *empowers many more people to become coders*, & that's how humans can keep up with the increasing demand for technology. 
    * At Intuita, we started with the simple task of code organization & we have more impactful use cases in the new updates. *You could have a say in the next automation we build!*
* **Now tell us! Which specific coding activities have recently wasted your time?**
