# Code Organizer For TypeScript

Intuita helps you to arrange the order of TS code blocks based on your preference to **facilitate code comprehension, refactoring & code review**.

## How Do I Use it?

1. **Open a ts/tsx file & let Intuita generates recommendations**
    1. By default, Intuita only organizes files that are more than 50 lines of code. You can change it in the settings. 
    2. The default organization rule is to place imports first, followed by types, interfaces, functions, classes & variables at the bottom of a file. You can change it in the settings.
3. **Accept/reject Intuita’s recommendations.**
    1. Recommendations are accessible via the Explorer sidebar or Intuita’s dedicated section in the left panel.
    2. You can tweak the recommended fix, if needed, before accepting. Make sure to save your edits before clicking on Accept.

## Why Is It Important?
**Big Files** (>300LOC) → **Big Problems**:
* <kbd>**Code Comprehension**</kbd>
    * Big messy error-prone files slow you down. Organizing legacy code is hard. Keeping a growing codebase organized is even harder.
    * You cannot effortlessly skim from top to bottom & make sense of large & disorganized files. You need to jump through the code up & down multiple times & memorize what happens at each step.
* <kbd>**Code Review**</kbd>
    * Code review becomes harder for unorganized files & the back & forth between reviewer & original author for simple changes like code arrangement waste a lot of time.
* <kbd>**Code Refactoring**</kbd>
    * It is hard to underst& when & how to refactor a large file into smaller, more maintainable pieces, especially when the code blocks are scattered.

## Can I Ask For More?
* YES! First, some context about us:
    * We are a bunch of nerds passionate about **automating the boring parts of coding**, one use case at a time. 
    * We believe code automation enables us to be **drastically more productive**. Besides that, automation reduces friction for coding & empowers many more people to become coders, so together, we keep up with the increasing demand for technology. 
    * At Intuita, we started with the simple task of code organization & we have **more impactful use cases in our roadmap.** You could have a say in the next automation we build!
* **Now! Which specific coding activities have recently wasted your time?**
