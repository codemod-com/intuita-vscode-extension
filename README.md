# Untangle & Move Fast.
Intuita helps you keep your code organized effortlessly & intelligently to **facilitate code comprehension, future refactoring, and code review.**
Intuita's algorithm takes into account a few dimensions:

* Definitions first, usages later
* Semantically similar code blocks closer together
* Similar types of code blocks closer together
* Other considerations you care about? [Let us know!](https://join.slack.com/t/intuita-inc/shared_invite/zt-1bjj5exxi-95yPfWi71HcO2p_sS5L2wA) 

## How does code organization help me?
Small files (e.g., less than 200LOC) might not need code organization, but as your code grows, it brings more problems with it:
- **Code Comprehension**
    - You cannot effortlessly skim from top to bottom and make sense of large and disorganized files. You need to jump through the code up and down multiple times and memorize what happens at each step.
- **Code Refactoring**
  - It is hard to understand when and how to refactor a large file into smaller, more maintainable pieces, especially when all the code blocks that could shape a meaningful chunk are scattered within many lines of code.

Let's make it more visual:
