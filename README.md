## Why would I need it as a Codemod Consumer?

If you want to run any codemod, you need to fetch its script and execute it over CLI. You will likely use version control to pick some of the resulting changes.

Does that sound already _tiresome_ to you?

Imagine now you need to run a dozen codemods to migrate your codebase from one version of some library to the other.

The initial process needs to be now repeated a dozen times...

Our Codemod Manager speeds up this process tremendously, as shown in the table below:

| Problem | Codemod | Codemod Manager |
|:--|:--:|--:|
| Fetching the script(s) | over CLI | already provided |
| Executing the script(s) | over CLI | within VSCode 
| Managing the changes| over VC | using UI

The only thing you need to care about now is picking the changes you want committed.

For that, we organize them into cases. One case corresponds all the changes from one codemod. You can accept or reject the entire case and you can accept or reject change by change.

## Why would I need it as a Codemod Builder?
After you have written a codemod, you want it to be adopted as widely as possible.

By cooperating with us you can add your codemod into our extension and speed up the adoption of changes for the users of your software.

## Why would I need it as an Engineering Lead?
You want your software to be as up to date as possible. Some codemods bring security updates while some grant your team more productivity.

Cooperate with us and allow your team to florish!

## Which codemods do we support?
* Next.js vX → v13
* Material UI v4 → v5

## Who are we?
